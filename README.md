# Random Number Generator App 
Thanks for looking into my random number generator. Works with .net core 3.1 using web apis to send data to the random number generator.
The random number generator uses 3 parameters, 1 for the amount of numbers to generate, 1 for the minimum value to generate and 1 for the 
max value to generate.
